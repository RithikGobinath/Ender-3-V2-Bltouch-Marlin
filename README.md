## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Credits

The current Marlin dev team consists of:

 - Marlin (@Marlin)
 - Jyers (@Jyers)
 
 This Firmware is a modification of the Jyers Marlin build as it is completly based on his version of marlin.
